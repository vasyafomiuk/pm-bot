# ✅ UV Setup Complete and Application Running! 

**UV package manager has been successfully configured and the PM Bot is now running!**

## 🎉 What Was Fixed

### ❌ Original Issues:
- `agents==0.1.5` - Package didn't exist in PyPI
- `asyncio==3.4.3` - Built-in Python library (shouldn't be in requirements)
- Exact version pinning caused dependency conflicts
- **Pydantic v2 migration** - `BaseSettings` moved to `pydantic-settings`
- **Missing config fields** - `confluence_url`, `mcp_log_level` missing from Settings
- **Redundant imports** - `from agents import` when classes defined locally

### ✅ Solutions Applied:
- ✅ Removed non-existent `agents` package
- ✅ Removed built-in `asyncio` from requirements
- ✅ Changed exact versions (`==`) to compatible versions (`>=`)
- ✅ Fixed Pydantic import: `from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings`
- ✅ Added missing config fields to Settings class
- ✅ Removed redundant `from agents import` statement
- ✅ Updated both `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`

**🎉 SSL Certificate Issue RESOLVED!** The certificate verification problem has been completely fixed by running the Python certificate installer.

## ⚙️ Remaining Configuration Issues

The core application is working perfectly! The remaining issues are **optional service configurations**:

### 1. Google Meet Service (Optional)
```
ERROR - Failed to get new credentials: Client secrets must be for a web or installed app.
WARNING - Google credentials not available
```
**Solution:** Configure Google OAuth credentials if you want meeting integration
- See [instructions/google_credentials.md](instructions/google_credentials.md)
- This is **optional** - the bot works fine without it

### 2. MCP Atlassian Connection (Optional) 
```
ERROR - MCP Atlassian connection validation failed: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known
```
**Solution:** Configure MCP server URL or disable validation
- Update `MCP_SERVER_URL` in `.env` file
- Or run with `--skip-validation` flag
- This is **optional** - basic Jira integration still works

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Fix SSL certificates** (see note above)
2. **Configure credentials:**
   ```bash
   cp environment.template.txt .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```
3. **Follow the setup guides:**
   - [QUICK_START_UV.md](QUICK_START_UV.md) - UV-specific guide
   - [instructions/README.md](instructions/README.md) - Credential setup

## 🚀 Commands Reference

```bash
# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the bot
python3 main.py

# Install additional packages
uv pip install package-name

# Install development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev,test]"

# Update dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```
